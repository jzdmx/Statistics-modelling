# Statistics-modelling
Since the United Nations established 21 November each year as the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, more and more countries around the world are observing this international day. It was only this year that I became aware of this worldwide day and was shocked by the statistics. We can go through the website (United Nations, 2021) set up by the United Nations to commemorate the scale of emotional and economic damage caused by road traffic accidents, and the real figures are alarming. Therefore, in addition to the need to constantly recognize the harm caused to victims of road traffic accidents; it is vital to prevent accidents from happening. The dataset used in this model is derived from the web and is a dataset of 795 observations and 10 variables, each of which is described in Table 1. These variables are all related to predictors such as the speed of the vehicle, the weather of the day, the traffic flow on the road.
